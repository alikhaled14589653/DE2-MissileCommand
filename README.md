## Project Overview

The **DE2-MissileCommand** project recreates the classic arcade game, Missile Command, using the Altera DE2-35 FPGA development board. This project serves as both a fun game and a practical demonstration of digital design concepts using Verilog and VHDL. 

Missile Command challenges players to protect cities from incoming missiles. Players control a missile launcher and must intercept the threats before they hit their targets. The project showcases the capabilities of the DE2-35 board, including its processing power and graphical output.

## Features

- **FPGA Implementation**: Fully functional game logic implemented in Verilog and VHDL.
- **Real-time Graphics**: Smooth graphics rendering on the DE2-35 board.
- **User Input Handling**: Responsive controls for a seamless gaming experience.
- **Sound Effects**: Engaging audio to enhance gameplay.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of player scores and displays them on-screen.

## Getting Started

To get started with **DE2-MissileCommand**, you will need the following:

### Prerequisites

- Altera DE2-35 Development Board
- Quartus Prime software for FPGA development
- A basic understanding of Verilog and VHDL
- A computer with a USB port for board connection

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alikhaled14589653/DE2-MissileCommand.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd DE2-MissileCommand
   ```

3. **Open the Project in Quartus**:
   Launch Quartus Prime and open the project file located in the `DE2-MissileCommand` directory.

4. **Compile the Design**:
   Compile the design to ensure everything is set up correctly. Resolve any errors that may arise during compilation.

5. **Upload to the DE2-35 Board**:
   Connect your DE2-35 board to your computer. Use the Programmer tool in Quartus to upload the compiled design to the board.

## Architecture

The architecture of **DE2-MissileCommand** consists of several key components:

- **Game Logic Module**: Handles the main game loop, including player input and game state updates.
- **Graphics Module**: Manages the rendering of game elements, such as missiles, cities, and the player's launcher.
- **Sound Module**: Plays sound effects based on game events, enhancing the overall experience.
- **Input Module**: Captures user input from buttons and joystick, translating them into game actions.

## Usage

After successfully uploading the game to your DE2-35 board, follow these steps to play:

1. **Power On the Board**: Ensure the board is powered and connected to a display.
2. **Start the Game**: Press the start button to initiate the game.
3. **Control the Launcher**: Use the joystick to move the missile launcher and fire missiles at incoming threats.
4. **Monitor Your Score**: Keep an eye on your score displayed on the screen. Try to beat your high score!

## Gameplay

The gameplay of **Missile Command** involves protecting three cities from waves of incoming missiles. As the player, you control a missile launcher that can fire missiles to intercept the threats. The game becomes progressively challenging as the speed and number of missiles increase.

### Scoring System

- Each missile successfully intercepted adds points to your score.
- Destroying multiple missiles in quick succession yields bonus points.
- Failing to protect a city results in a score penalty.

### Game Over

The game ends when all cities are destroyed. A summary of your score and performance will be displayed, allowing you to compare with previous attempts.
